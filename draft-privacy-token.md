This documents defines an authentication scheme for HTTP called Privacy Token.

# Introduction {#introduction}

This document defines a new HTTP authentication scheme {{!RFC7235}}
named "PrivacyToken".

This scheme is built to be used to authenticate to proxies, using the
Proxy-Authorization header field, with a blind signature that allows a proxy
to verify that a client has a token signed by a particular key, but without
identifying the client. The initial version of this scheme is intended to be
used with RSA Blind Signatures {{RSASIG}}.

## Requirements

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# Privacy Token Structure {#struct}

A privacy token is a structure that begins with a single byte that indicates
a version. This document defines version, 1, which indicates use of
private tokens based on RSA Blind Signatures {{RSASIG}}, and determines the
rest of the structure contents.

~~~
struct {
    uint8_t version;
    uint8_t key_id[32];
    uint8_t message[32];
    uint8_t signature[Nk];
} Token;
~~~

The structure fields are defined as follows:

- "version" is a 1-octet integer. This document defines version 1.

- "key_id" is a collision-resistant hash that identifies the key used to produce
the signature. This is generated as SHA256(public_key), where public_key
is a DER-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo object carrying the public key.

- "message" is a 32-octet random message that is signed by the
signature.

- "signature" is a Nk-octet RSA Blind Signature that covers the
message.  For version 1, Nk is indicated by size of the Token
structure and may be 256, 384, or 512.
These correspond to RSA 2048, 3072, and 4096 bit keys.
Clients implementing version 1 MUST support signature
sizes with Nk of 512 and 256.

# PrivacyToken Authentication Scheme {#scheme}

The "PrivacyToken" authentication scheme defines one parameter, "token".
All unknown or unsupported parameters to "PrivacyToken" authentication
credentials MUST be ignored.

The value of the "token" parameter is a Privacy Token Structure {{struct}},
encoded using base64url encoding {{!RFC4648}}.

As an example, a Proxy-Authorization field in an HTTP request would look like:

~~~
Proxy-Authorization: PrivacyToken token=abc...
~~~

# Security Considerations {#security}

Note that the KeyID is only a hint to identify the public verification key. With
a sufficiently large number of public keys, KeyID collisions may occur.
By approximation, a KeyID collision between two distinct keys will occur
with probability sqrt(p * 2^33). In such cases, servers SHOULD attempt
verification using both keys.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This document registers the "PrivacyToken" authentication scheme in the
"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme Registry"
established by {{!RFC7235}}.
